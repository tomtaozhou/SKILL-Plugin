The SKILL plugin is developed for the Ubi-House system, facilitating the seamless integration among various Ubi-House smart devices.

## Key Features

## Description

Within the Ubi-House smart home ecosystem, all Ubi-House smart devices can interface with the SKILL module via the ActivityPub API. The core responsibility of the SKILL module is to produce control commands according to predetermined rules, subsequently sending them to the Ubi-House devices. 

The design and implementation of the SKILL plugin are based on WordPress and support the ActivityPub protocol. After setting up the WordPress-based plugin framework, interfaces handling the ActivityPub protocol were developed using PHP. This includes the receiving and parsing of device information, creating control commands, and dispatching them to the devices. Additionally, a user interface was designed to showcase device statuses and accept user commands.

## Installation

1. Upload the 'skill' plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress-based Ubi-House system.
